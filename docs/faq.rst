Questions and answers about the CAL-ACCESS database

How far back does the database go?
----------------------------------

According to `the official state documentation <http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1308002-cal-access-about.html#document/p235>`_, electronic disclosure documents
started being filed in CAL-ACCESS on Jan. 1, 2000. Historical analysis of the database,
should start from that date, the documentation says.
