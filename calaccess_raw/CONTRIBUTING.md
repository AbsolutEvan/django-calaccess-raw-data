## What is the California Civic Data Coalition?

The California Civic Data Coalition is a loosely coupled team of journalists from the Los Angeles Times Data Desk, the Washington Post, The Center for Investigative Reporting and Stanford's Computational Journalism Lab.

The coalition was formed in 2014 by Ben Welsh and Agustin Armendariz to lead the development of open-source software that makes California's public data easier to access and analyze. The effort has drawn hundreds of contributions from developers and journalists at dozens of competing news outlets.

Its primary focus is refining CAL-ACCESS, the jumbled, dirty and difficult government database that tracks campaign finance and lobbying activity in California politics.

In 2015 the coalition was named a winner of the Knight News Challenge and awarded $250,000 in philanthropic funding from the Knight Foundation, the Democracy Fund, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Rita Allen Foundation.
